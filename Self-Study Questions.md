5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

## ANSWER

Github is a great way to handle and maintain code for a developer in the sense that it keeps everything organized with the ability to undo any unwanted actions. You can also push directly to servers so there is more consistency with that side of the transfer.

Developers use git to do things like:

Repository - You have your repository, which is usually a library of files which you work from.

Revisioning - Git keeps an eye on each revision you make with the option of 'reverting' to a previous version, should the need arise.

Collaboration - Multiple people can pull and push code to the repository, making it a centralized source

Forks - sort of an off-shoot of previous code. Forks are great for taking a basic example and further customizing the code because the initial code is still intact should other avenues be explored.

Issue system - good way of handling any technical issues with the code with people being able to respond to particular sections
